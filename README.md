## Description

_An RPG (Role Playing Game) is a game where players assume the roles of characters in a fictional world_

## Epicodus Prompt
* Character creation: Use composition to generate different character types. Be creative with your character types... warriors, wizards, scientists, prom queen... whatever! Characters should have specific attributes. For instance, in a medieval RPG, characters might have strength and intelligence attributes among others. In an '80's high school RPG, characters might have snark and charm. You can add and even update these attributes using composition.

* Battle system: Many RPGs have a battle system so characters can fight monsters, though that could just as easily be a high school “battle” system where the prom queen has a dance-off with the theater aficionado. Determine conditions for "winning" a battle, whether that's defeating monsters (with swords and spells doing damage), accumulating dance-off style points, or any other system you think of.

* Level up: Determine a leveling system. Characters should be able to go from Level 1 to Level 2 and so on. Generally each level comes with new abilities. How do characters level up in your game? What attributes and powers do they gain? Does their strength go up or do they learn new spells? You will need to use some object-oriented programming to complete this objective — characters can be individual objects with their own set of attributes.

* Inventory: Characters should be able to have items that enhance their abilities. Maybe the Magic Armor increases their defense power or legwarmers increase their dance-off ability. Create a limit to the number of items a character can have. Characters should be able to add, drop, buy and sell items.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _clone the repository to your desktop from: https://github.com/MGantz22/Functional-RPG.git_
* _enter command in terminal: $ `npm install`_
* _enter command in terminal: $ `npm run build`_
* _enter command in terminal: $ `npm run start`_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
